# TO DO
1. Matching Tiles Game
 + Making Activities (fragments), .xml files
 + Making the gameActivity/board/boardManager

2. Connect Four Game
 + Same as above, Meirbek has backend code

7. Personal Scores and Scoreboard aren't returned.
 + Leaderboard not functional
 + Consideration: Probably need to load a separate leaderboard from file


8. Test suite
 + Please add javadoc for the tests so everyone else knows what they do when you write them :)

9. Make "Choose user image" dynamic to a different message (in SlidingTiles)
 + "Use Image"
 + "Use Tiles"

10. Refactor Activity Classes
