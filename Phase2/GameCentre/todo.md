# TO DO
1. Matching Tiles Game
 + Making Activities (fragments), .xml files
 + Making the gameActivity/slidingBoard/boardManager

2. Connect Four Game
 + Same as above, Meirbek has backend code

7. Personal Scores and Scoreboard aren't returned. (Jonathan is working on this)
 + Leaderboard is not being updated
 + Save functionality probably doesn't work for the leaderboard


8. Test suite
 + Please add javadoc for the tests so everyone else knows what they do when you write them :)

10. Refactor Activity Classes
