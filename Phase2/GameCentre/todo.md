# TO DO
1. Personal Scores and Scoreboard aren't returned.
2. On destroy - Back button takes you out of app
3. Back button can take you back to previous users -> when are we saving to file?
4. Refactor Activity Classes
5. Rework Intents?
6. Login null crash (clear data)
7. Phase 2 to do - add two games (scoreboard, undo, save). Possible games - IceTile, Solitaire, etc)
8. Test suite
9. Game freeze once finished rather than redirecting to title screen right away
