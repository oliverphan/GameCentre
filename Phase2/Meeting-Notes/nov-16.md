### Meeting Nov 16 2018
#### Suggestions for changing leaderboard display
1. Have Leaderboard updated ONLY when game is won
2. Get rid of Leaderboard class, and only reconstruct a Leaderboard "View" when in the activity, sorting the User list everytime based on Game highscores

### Other

+ New design: Using a separate file for the current User to be passed around
+ Instantiating boardManager in TitleActivity

### Future maybe goals
