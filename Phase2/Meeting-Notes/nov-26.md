### Meeting Nov 25 2018:

### Update on Tasks completed as of today:
+ Memory:
 + Implementing undo
 + Fixed timing issue when user tries to click when two cards are flipped over

#### Tasks in motion
+ Matching cards Ggame
+ Jonathan on Leaderboard

### Tasks still need to be done
+ Create New folders/directory layout for the app (consequently, appropiate packages as well)
+ Memory:
 + Implementing undo
  + There should be two states the gameActivity is in, on first card selection or selection of second card
  + Thus undo and isMatched should only work on second Card Selection

### Design decisions
+ There should be two states the gameActivity is in, on first card selection or selection of second card
  + Thus undo and isMatched should only work on second Card Selection
  + User will then be able to see what cards were selected even if they didn't match
